This repository contains my project titled Youtube Data Harvesting and Warehousing.
Data Retrieval:
Users can input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve relevant data from the YouTube channels.
Data includes channel name, subscribers, total video count, likes, dislikes, comments, and more.
Store Data:
The app allows users to collect and store data for up to 10 different YouTube channels in a data lake with a simple button click.
Data Analysis:
Data stored in MySQL can be retrieved using different search options, enabling users to analyze and derive insights from the collected data.
Technologies and Frameworks Used:
Python: The application is built using Python programming language, leveraging its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.
Streamlit: The front-end interface and user interactions are developed using Streamlit, a popular open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science.
Google API: The app integrates the YouTube Data API for fetching data from YouTube channels.
MySQL: Data storage and retrieval are facilitated using MySQL database.
Steps to follow before running the code:Obtain the required API keys and set up the credentials for MySQL.Run the Streamlit app using the command streamlit run app.py
